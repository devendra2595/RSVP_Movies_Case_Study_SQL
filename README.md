# Problem Introduction
RSVP Movies is an Indian film production company which has produced many super-hit movies. They have usually released movies for the Indian audience but for their next project, they are planning to release a movie for the global audience in 2022.

The production company wants to plan their every move analytically based on data and have approached you for help with this new project. You have been provided with the data of the movies that have been released in the past three years. You have to analyse the data set and draw meaningful insights that can help them start their new project. 

You have to use SQL to analyse the given data and give recommendations to RSVP Movies based on the insights.

# Some of the important functions used to analyse the data are:
  - Commom Table Expressions
  - Views
  - Window Function
  - Rank Function
  - Case statements
  - Joins

# Important Insights

Below are some of the important insights drawn after analysing the data.

- An average of 2666 movies were produced per year.
- Highest number of movies are produced in March with slightly lesser movie count in Jan, Sept & Oct. These 4 months should be top priority for movie production.
- More than 50% of total movies were produced by India & USA together in 2019 which makes USA a potential market for new project.
- With a total of 4285 movies, 106 minutes average length and 7.06 average rating(weighted), Drama holds the position of the most popular genre.
- A hit movie has to surpass almost 90% (median rating above 8) of the movies produced. Highest number of hit movies were given by “Dream Warrior Pictures” or “National Theatre Live” and for multilingual hit movies, “Star Cinema” or “Twentieth Century Fox”. But based on popularity w.r.t. public votes “Marvel Studios” and “Twentieth Century Fox” are leading. Considering all the above facts, “Twentieth Century Fox” would be the most viable production house.
- While hiring a director, the first priority should be given to “James Mangold” and second can be given to either of Anthony Russo, Joe Russo or Soubin Shahir.
- Mammooty and Mohanlal are the top two actors with highest number of hit movies. 
- In order to provide regional touch, the Indian top-rated actor and actress, “Vijay Sethupathi” & “Taapsee Pannu” should also be casted.
- In Drama genre, based on number of super-hit movies the top 3 actresses are Parvathy Thiruvothu, Susan Brown and Amanda Lawrence
